[Branchlet's submission for the Ludum Dare 48 game jam.](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/hungry-jungle)

Dive deeper and deeper into the Hungry Jungle! A single survivor finds himself in a peculiar place, riddled with odd plants and dangerous creatures. Are there other survivors in the jungle? Will he be able to assemble a team, and find his way out?

This is a procedurally generated dungeon-like jungle game with a huge scope for the short time-span!

Thereâ€™s a ranged + melee combat system with 6 different monsters and 6 weapons. There are 4 character types that you can find, each with some internal variation. There are also 14 different berry-bushes, which brings us to the question: How did humans find out which plants are safe to eat? Well, I suppose you will find the answer to this question if you want to beat the game!

Controls: The game only uses mouse controls. Right click + drag to select characters and left click (once) to interact with objects in the game.
